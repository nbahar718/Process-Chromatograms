# Process Chromatograms using Python Data Analysis

### Procedure
1. Get the chromatogram data from the chromatography instrument with target parameters.
2. Adjust the data in the form of a table as represented in reference.xlsx file.
3. Adjust the following parameters in te code -
  - X-axis column volume (CV) labels for each subsequent stage
  - Y-axis individual parameters to get them in the range as defined in the data table (suggested way is to get MAX and MIN values in each row)
  - Secondary X-axis labels that identify each process stage
5. Run the python program to get the PNG file of the chromatogram
